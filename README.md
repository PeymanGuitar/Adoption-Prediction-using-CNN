# Adoption-Prediction-using-CNN

In this project, we have datasets consisted of training and test sets in which they consist of photos
of pets in an animal shelter. The folders 1, 2, 3, 4 consist of photos of pets that are adopted within a week, adopted between 8 and 30 days, adopted between 31 and 90 days and adopted after 100 days respectively. We use Convolutional Neural Network to predict the adoptation category of the pets which is accurate for 99 percent.
